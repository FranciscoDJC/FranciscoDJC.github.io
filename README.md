Feature that i add on my Personal website -Glow effect whenever a viewer hovers their mouse over the picture under the portfolio tab

Changes in my website that devuiated from my original digital wireframe

Changes on my tab's looks ( there is a slight difference an the reason is that i cant configure the part where the grey box where the text "Hi there my names derrick" Sshould be overlayed with the pink background box and it also have the same issues as the Portfolio and Contact Tab.)
i cant reposition the text wher its supposed to be since if i had gone with the original concept, the texts will jumble and resize itself to the point that it is unreadable. -I added more than 4 photos in my portfolio and the reason is to just fill out empty spaces and also, 4 isnt enough for me as if its lacking some display to showcase my skills.
